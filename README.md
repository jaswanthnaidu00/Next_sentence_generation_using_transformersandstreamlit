# üß† Next Sentence Prediction using Generative AI (GPT-2)

This project demonstrates a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application using **Generative AI** to perform **Next Sentence Prediction**. By leveraging the pre-trained GPT-2 model from Hugging Face Transformers, the system generates contextually relevant next sentences based on user input. The entire solution is built with **Streamlit**, providing a simple web interface for interaction.

## üí° Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate a predictive text system similar to smart compose or auto-complete features. Users enter a partial sentence, and the system returns three possible next full sentences based on the input. This showcases the potential of transformer-based language models in practical applications such as writing assistants, chatbots, and educational tools.
